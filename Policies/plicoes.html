            <div id="cont1">
                <div>Welcome to ChanakyaUni - Your Path to Upskilling Excellence!</div>
                <div>Thank you for choosing ChanakyaUni for your upskilling journey. We are committed to providing
                    high-quality courses and a rewarding learning experience. Please take a moment to review our refund
                    policy below.</div>

                <div>Refund Policy Overview: At ChanakyaUni, we offer a range of carefully curated upskilling courses
                    designed to empower learners with valuable knowledge and skills. We invest significant resources in
                    maintaining the quality of our courses and ensuring that our learners receive maximum benefit from
                    their enrollment.</div>
                <div>
                    As of [Date], ChanakyaUni has adopted a no-refund policy for all course enrollments. This policy is
                    in place due to the nature of our digital content and the immediate access provided upon enrollment.
                    Once you gain access to the course materials, we are unable to offer refunds.
                </div>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Instant Access: Our courses provide immediate access to digital content, allowing learners to
                        begin their learning journey instantly. Given the nature of this access, we are unable to revoke
                        or recover course materials once they have been accessed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Course Value: We are committed to delivering courses that provide value and enhance your
                        knowledge and skills. The course content, instruction, and resources are available for review
                        before enrollment, allowing you to make an informed decision.

                    circumstances can arise. In cases where a course was not accessible due to technical issues on our
                    end, we will work to resolve the issue and provide access to the course content.
                </div>
                <div>
